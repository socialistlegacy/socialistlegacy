Indeed I live in the dark ages!<br>
A guileless word is an absurdity. A smooth forehead betokens<br>
A hard heart. He who laughs<br>
Has not yet heard<br>
The terrible tidings.

Ah, what an age it is<br>
When to speak of trees is almost a crime<br>
For it is a kind of silence about injustice!<br>
And he who walks calmly across the street,<br>
Is he not out of reach of his friends<br>
In trouble?

It is true: I earn my living<br>
But, believe me, it is only an accident.<br>
Nothing that I do entitles me to eat my fill.<br>
By chance I was spared. (If my luck leaves me<br>
I am lost.)

They tell me: eat and drink. Be glad you have it!<br>
But how can I eat and drink<br>
When my food is snatched from the hungry<br>
And my glass of water belongs to the thirsty?<br>
And yet I eat and drink.

I would gladly be wise.<br>
The old books tell us what wisdom is:<br>
Avoid the strife of the world<br>
Live out your little time<br>
Fearing no one<br>
Using no violence<br>
Returning good for evil ---<br>
Not fulfillment of desire but forgetfulness<br>
Passes for wisdom.<br>
I can do none of this:<br>
Indeed I live in the dark ages!

I came to the cities in a time of disorder<br>
When hunger ruled.<br>
I came among men in a time of uprising<br>
And I revolted with them.<br>
So the time passed away<br>
Which on earth was given me.<br>

I ate my food between massacres.<br>
The shadow of murder lay upon my sleep.<br>
And when I loved, I loved with indifference.<br>
I looked upon nature with impatience.<br>
So the time passed away<br>
Which on earth was given me.

In my time streets led to the quicksand.<br>
Speech betrayed me to the slaughterer.<br>
There was little I could do. But without me<br>
The rulers would have been more secure. This was my hope.<br>
So the time passed away<br>
Which on earth was given me.

You, who shall emerge from the flood<br>
In which we are sinking,<br>
Think ---<br>
When you speak of our weaknesses,<br>
Also of the dark time<br>
That brought them forth.

For we went, changing our country more often than our shoes.<br>
In the class war, despairing<br>
When there was only injustice and no resistance.<br>

For we knew only too well:<br>
Even the hatred of squalor<br>
Makes the brow grow stern.<br>
Even anger against injustice<br>
Makes the voice grow harsh. Alas, we<br>
Who wished to lay the foundations of kindness<br>
Could not ourselves be kind.

But you, when at last it comes to pass<br>
That man can help his fellow man,<br>
Do no judge us<br>
Too harshly.
