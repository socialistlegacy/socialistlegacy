The Agitator, vol. 1, no. 1, November 15, 1910

In the Hour of Execution.\
by William Francis Barnard

1887.

Is this what we must bear, O Freedom, Mother,\
&nbsp; &nbsp;To see thy face and but to touch thy hand?\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is there no easier way?\
Must death another take, and yet another,\
&nbsp; &nbsp;While tears and lamentations thru the land\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Show the great price we pay?\
Yet, if it must be, Freedom, none say nay.

See, Thou, these waiting for the hangman’s halter;---\
&nbsp; &nbsp;These friends of man, must there be given to death?\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Freedom, we ask again!\
If in the sacrifice we do not falter,\
&nbsp; &nbsp;Wilt thou repay us for their strangled breath?\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wilt thou come nearer men?\
Thou wilt, we hope. With groans we give these, then.

The debt is paid!---Thy martyrs lie before us,
   Their mute lips speak they words into our ears,
      And bid us seek thee far.
Freedom, we know thy sun shall yet shine o’er us;
   And looking up, exalted, thru our tears,
      We cry, beneath thy star,
“Take these! Take us, if need be; thine we are!”
