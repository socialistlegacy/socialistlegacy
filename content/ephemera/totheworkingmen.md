Bring out your standard Workingmen,\
&nbsp; &nbsp;And give its folds free air;\
Now raise it to the loftiest peak,\
&nbsp; &nbsp;And boldly nail it there.<!--more-->

Now lift on high each toil-worn hand---\
&nbsp; &nbsp;Invoke each holy Fane;\
And swear you’ll never cease to strive\
&nbsp; &nbsp;Till man his rights obtain.

Give work to every son of want,\
&nbsp; &nbsp;Be hope no more defer’d,\
And be the *Voice of Industry*\
&nbsp; &nbsp;On ever hill top heard.

Be this our motto evermore\
&nbsp; &nbsp;While Ocean rolls a wave,\
That glorious Being we adore\
&nbsp; &nbsp;Ne’er made nor own’d a slave.
