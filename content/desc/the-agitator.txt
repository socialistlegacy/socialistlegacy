_**The Agitator**_ was a radical newspaper published by [Jay Fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Fox "Jay Fox") of the [anarchist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchist "Anarchist") [Home Colony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home,_Washington "Home, Washington") in the American state of [Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state) "Washington (state)") from 1910 to 1912\.

In 1913 the paper was briefly relaunched as _**The Syndicalist**_ as the official organ of [William Z. Foster's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Z._Foster "William Z. Foster") [Syndicalist League of North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndicalist_League_of_North_America "Syndicalist League of North America"), at which time it was moved first to [Lakebay, Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakebay,_Washington "Lakebay, Washington") and thereafter to [Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago "Chicago").

_The Agitator_ and its successor were among the most important written vehicles for [anarcho-syndicalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchosyndicalism "Anarchosyndicalism") ideas in America during the decade of the 1910s.
