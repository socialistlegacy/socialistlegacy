The legacy of socialism is a legacy of failure. 

Socialism was born in the early 19th century. By the dawn of the 20th century that movement was poised to change the world through international revolution. But the revolution failed.

The world did change, but not for the better. The result of the failed revolution was, [in the words of Rosa Luxemburg](https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1915/junius/ch01.htm), the regression of society to barbarism. Capitalism proved not a passing, transitional phase on the way to a higher form of human emancipation that would both complete and transcend the bourgeois revolutionary epoch, but the degeneration of that revolutionary society, its collapse back into the bloody domination of man by man it had presumed to overcome.

We are now buried beneath the rubble of a catastrophe that has brought centuries of progress to ruin. To the extent that socialism is remembered at all, it is reduced to a grotesque mockery of its former aspirations. “Socialism” has come to mean, for its detractors and proponents alike, the preservation of the status quo at best; at worst, wallowing in the ongoing self-destruction of society as if this were “revolutionary”.

Socialism once promised to realize a freedom made possible but also undermined by the industrial revolution: freedom for all human beings from the burden of compulsory labor, freedom for the full development of the capacities of every individual and of social cooperation in all forms. This promise has been squandered and forgotten. Those condemned to perform labor that is no longer necessary now fight to the death for the opportunity to slave their lives away, or else succumb to the misery and degradation of unemployment.

Those who would remain true to the socialist legacy must remember this promise, keep faith with it, and refuse to allow the traces of its memory to be erased in the name of “progress”, even if that progress is promised by “socialists” and called “socialism”. We must remember what socialism once meant, if that meaning is ever to be recovered as more than a utopian dream of past generations.

Fortunately, the written record of the old socialist tradition is prolific, and in substantial measure readily available. Yet this has proven an obstacle as well, as the old texts that are still read can and generally are read wrongly, because their context has been forgotten and replaced by a falsified understanding of history that celebrates the victory of capitalism and of those “socialists” who gave up on revolution and adapted to defeat.

The purpose of this project is not really political or even educational, but aesthetic. It seeks not to propagate the right ideas, nor to correct misunderstandings, but to reflect and reflect upon a sensibility that was lost long ago. It seeks to inculcate a suspicion that something essential is missing from contemporary discussions of “socialism”, for and against.

It seeks to do so by plumbing into the depths of the archives of the old socialist tradition, recovering fragments that might perplex or astound or captivate the reader or viewer, to provoke at once wonder and melancholy, and more importantly, to induce a desire for critical reflection. 

Deeper consideration of this legacy and its loss is, at least at present, beyond the scope of this project, but anyone moved to so reflect is strongly encouraged to engage with the work of the [Platypus Affiliated Society](http://platypus1917.org/), whose mission is precisely to educate the new generation in the meaning of this tradition and its loss.

*The Socialist Legacy* intends to [brush history against the grain](https://www.sfu.ca/~andrewf/CONCEPT2.html), to expose the constellation our moment forms invisibly with an earlier one, lost in the thickets of long ago, in hopes that the continuum of history into which both are assimilated might still be blown sky-high.

“Only that historian will have the gift of fanning the spark of hope in the past who is firmly convinced that *even the dead* will not be safe from the enemy if he wins. And this enemy has not ceased to be victorious.”

“We are like the Jews that Moses led through the desert. But we are not lost, and we will be victorious if we have not unlearned how to learn.”
