The purpose of this project is not really political or even educational, but aesthetic. It seeks not to propagate the right ideas, nor to correct misunderstandings, but to reflect and reflect upon a sensibility that was lost long ago. It seeks to inculcate a suspicion that something essential is missing from contemporary discussions of “socialism”, for and against.

It seeks to do so by plumbing into the depths of the archives of the old socialist tradition, recovering fragments that might perplex or astound or captivate the reader or viewer, to provoke at once wonder and melancholy, and more importantly, to induce a desire for critical reflection. 

*The Socialist Legacy* intends to [brush history against the grain](https://www.sfu.ca/~andrewf/CONCEPT2.html), to expose the constellation our moment forms invisibly with an earlier one, lost in the thickets of long ago, in hopes that the continuum of history into which both are assimilated might still be blown sky-high.
